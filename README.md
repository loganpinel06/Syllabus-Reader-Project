# Syllabus Reader Project
The Syllabus Reader Project uses several Python libraries to read my class's PDF syllabus files and find the course calendar and generate a table of the semester calendar with dates, topics, and quizzes/exams.
This was my first attempt to build a project to solve a real "problem" I had. 
The program is still unfinished but it is near completion.

What I Learned:
- I learned how to use several Python libraries including os, regex, pypdf, pandas, and tabulate
- I learned how to use programming to solve real-world problems and create something that I would use in the real world.
- Learned a lot about teaching myself topics and how to affectively learn programing by myself.
- I learned how to debug, troubleshoot, and to accept the fact that things won't always work right away.
- I learned how to parse through large amounts of data.
