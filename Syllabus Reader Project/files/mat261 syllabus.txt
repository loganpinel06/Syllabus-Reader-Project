BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSE
MAT 261 is a continuation of the calculus sequence. We begin with a review of integration
techniques from Calculus I and cover chapters 5-10 of the text. This course covers advanced
integration techniques and applications, parametric and polar curves, sequences, and infinite series.
COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES
After the successful completion of this course, each student will:
1. be able to find the integral of functions using advanced techniques of integration including
integration by parts, trigonometric integration, trigonometric substitution, partial fractions,
approximate integration, and improper integrals.
2. apply integration concepts by using them to compute areas between curves, volumes by
slicing, volumes by cylindrical shells, arc length, area of a surface of revolution, and work.
3. analyze the convergence of sequences and infinite series and use them to evaluate integrals.
4. describe curves using parametric equations and polar coordinates and will apply the methods
of calculus to these curves.
1TEXT AND MATERIALS
Textbook Title: “University Calculus: Early Transcendentals
ISBN: 9780 1349 95540
Edition: Fourth
Year: 2019
Publisher: Pearson
Available: UT Bookstore, Amazon, and other retail booksellers.
Graphing Calculator: I will be using Graphing Calculator TI83 plus for class demonstrations.
It will be helpful if you also have one of your own. Other types of graphing calculator may be
used.
Mymathlab: Mymathlab is an online homework system offered by the publisher. You can create
your account and buy the access code online or use the access code that you buy from the book
store. The course ID is: khanal22730 .
HOMEWORK
The homework is an extremely important part of the course. There will be online homework
for every section we cover. The maximum possible points for the online homework is 100. The
Computer does not award partial credit, so I encourage you to work well before you choose and
write your solution in computer. I encourage you to work together if you find it helpful. In order
to be successful in learning the material and doing well on the examinations, you must think very
hard about the problems yourself before discussing them with anyone else.
QUIZZES
Each student may earn quizzes score of up to 100 points by taking in-class/online quizzes. Some of
the quiz problems will be based on homework problems. The dates of these quizzes are mentioned
inthe class schedule attached with this syllabus.
GRADING
The course grade will be based on a total of 600 points composed of 300 points for the three
mid-term exams, 100 points for the final exam, 100 points for the online homework and 100 points
for the in-class/online Quizzes. Letter grades will be assigned as follows:
•92% and above: A •88%-91%: AB
•82%-87%: B •78%-81%: BC
•72%-77%: C •68%-71%: CD
•60%-67%: D •Below 59%: F
2ATTENDANCE POLICY AND EXTRA CREDIT
I expect you to attend every class session. Experience has shown a definite correlation between
poor class attendance and low grades. I will value your attendance and participation for the class.
You will obtain 6 points at most for the attendance. Each absence will result in the attendance
score decreasing by 2 points. Your attendance score will be used as an extra credit.
MAKEUP EXAMS AND QUIZZES
Makeup exams will be given only for very serious and unavoidable conflicts or emergencies and only
if your request to present a make-up examination is approved by your instructor IN ADVANCE.
At the instance that a make-up examination is appropriate, it will be given within a week and is
typically more difficult than that of the scheduled exam. There is NO any makeup for the missed
quiz.
EXAM SCHEDULE
Term Exams: Three one hour exams worth 100 points each will be given as follows:
•Exam I on Monday, September 30, 2024,
•Exam II on Friday, November 1, 2024,
•Exam III on Monday, November 25, 2024,
Final Exam: A comprehensive final exam will be given on Wednesday,December 11, 2024 from
3:45 to 5:45 pm at SFB 288.

which could interrupt the schedule of classes, each student is asked to access UT Homepage for
information about the status of the campus and class meetings. In addition, please refer to UT

ing this information.
Academic Integrity Statement: The University of Tampa is committed to the development of
each student to become a productive and responsible citizen who embraces the values of honesty,
trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Upholding academic integrity and promoting an ethical
standard that does not condone academic misconduct is an important demonstration of these val-
ues and underpins how we live and learn in a community of inquiry. Students are expected to act
ethically in the pursuit of their education and to avoid behaviors that run counter to participation
4in and demonstration of their learning. The Academic Integrity Policy lists several common types
of violations related to cheating, unauthorized collaboration or assistance, plagiarism, and more.
While the policy lists common violations and examples, it is not an exhaustive list and instructors
may identify other types of conduct that impacts their ability to evaluate what has been learned
substantively enough to constitute a violation of this policy. An instructor may impose a wide
range of sanctions for academic integrity violations from completing a more difficult replacement
assignment to an F in the course. Particularly severe violations or multiple violations throughout
a student’s academic career may result in suspension or expulsion from the University.
Attendance Policy and Excused Absences: The University of Tampa has a General At-
tendance Policy in the Catalog. As stated, students are expected to attend class and academic
programs and individual faculty may require specified levels of attendance for successful com-
pletion of a course. However, the University has identified specific types of absences as either
excused or unexcused absences. Students should be aware of each type of absence and the impact
on their ability to complete work that was missed during their absence. Faculty must be notified
of scheduled excused absences in advance in order for students to receive accommodation for work
missed. The type of absence must fall within the categories specified in the catalog and the faculty
member may determine how far in advance notification must be provided.
Certain types of unscheduled absences may also qualify as excused. Faculty may require docu-
mentation or verification. This would include isolation or quarantine due to COVID. The policy
requires faculty to accommodate excused absences, including graded work, in a fair manner. This
is determined by the faculty member and is dependent on the structure of the course and what
work was missed. This may include replacement of work with something equivalent or having
the work excluded from the student’s grade. Faculty are NOT required or expected to provide
accommodation through remote access to the class or by providing a recording of the class session.
Faculty may determine that a student has missed too much participant-dependent work to suc-
cessfully accomplish learning outcomes, even if the absences meet the criteria for excused absences.
Faculty are not required to allow a student to make up work missed due to unexcused absences.
Class Disruption Statement: Every student has the right to a comfortable learning environ-
ment where the open and honest exchange of ideas may freely occur. Each student is expected to
do his or her part to ensure that the classroom (and anywhere else the class may meet) remains
conducive to learning. This includes respectful and courteous treatment of all in the classroom.
According to the terms of the University of Tampa Disruption Policy, the professor will take
immediate action when inappropriate behavior occurs. Details of the policy may be found at
Disruption of the Academic Process.
Academic Support – UT Center for Mathematics The UT Center for Mathematics, located
in MKE 118, offers open tutoring hours for students of all levels and abilities. The Center for Math-
ematics is open for drop-in tutoring for this course with no appointment necessary. Please visit to
